To compile:
============
asetup AthAnalysisBase,2.0.14
cd btagIBLAnalysis/cmt
cmt config
cmt make

============
To run:
============
cd ../../run
athena jobOptions.py

============
Result: job should have created an ntuple file with several branches
[can also create a histos.root file (with basic plots) and a xAOD.pool.root file (which is a new xAOD file with only a few containers written out) but this is commented out for now]
