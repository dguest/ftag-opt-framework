Updating instructions: THIS MAINLY AIM AT RUNNING THE OPTIMISATION FRAMEWOTK OVER REL20 SAMPLES.
- when no re-tagging options are chose the current setup should run over multiple file version
- when re-tagging there can be issue with backward compatibility. For the sake of not confusing user, I keep only the instructions valid for the latest setup. If something else is attempted please contact me (valerio.dao@cern.ch)


===========================================
To compile:
===========================================
asetup 20.1.4.6,AtlasProduction,gcc48,here  (I haven't tried more recent release, but you need AtlasProduction or AtlasDerivarion if you want to retag since you need MagField info)
pkgco.py JetCalibTools-00-04-35   (needed for the latest jet calibration)

svn co svn+ssh://svn.cern.ch/reps/atlasperf/CombPerf/FlavorTag/FlavourTagPerformanceFramework/trunk/xAODAthena xAODAthena
cd xAODAthena/btagIBLAnalysis/cmt
cmt config
source ./setup.sh
cmt make

=====================================================================
To run:
=====================================================================
cd ../../run
athena jobOptions.py

(follow the instructions inside to decide whether to tag or not, which jet collections to use, etc)

=====================================================================
To submit samples on the grid:
=====================================================================
- edit " mc_samples.txt " with the samples you want to run
- edit " submitJobs.py " with your grid usedName, production suffix


======================================================================
Result: job should have created an ntuple file with several branches
======================================================================
